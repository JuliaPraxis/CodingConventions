# Choosing and Using Names

It is easier to understand what `facial_recognition` does than it is to understand what `facer` does.   
These brief guides collect information on best practices and sound approaches using names with Julia.  

Using good naming practices and choosing names that clarify your intent makes your software better:  
easier to maintain, nicer for others to use and peruse, and it smooths later collaborative work.
